## Version History

### Versioning Strategy

We follow Semantic Versioning:

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to component APIs, token structure, or behavior
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): New components, features, or tokens (backwards compatible)
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Release Cadence

- **Major releases**: Annually or as needed for breaking changes
- **Minor releases**: Monthly for new features
- **Patch releases**: Weekly or as needed for bug fixes

### Deprecation Policy

When deprecating components or APIs:

1. Mark as deprecated in current version
2. Provide migration guide
3. Maintain for at least one major version
4. Remove in next major version

Example:
```
v1.5.0: Component deprecated, migration guide provided
v1.6.0 - v1.9.0: Deprecated component still available
v2.0.0: Deprecated component removed
```

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes will be clearly documented with:
- What changed

Example:
```markdown
